## About the creator

Hello trainer, I'm [Javier](https://itsjavi.com), a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer from Spain & based in Berlin,
who among other many things, loves Pokémon and Nintendo games.

I've been playing Pokémon since Red and Blue and after all these years I am still as passionate about it as always,
especially before the release of a new generation when everyone is so hyped.

I created this website because I'd loved the idea to build a great community of Pokémon fans, and build tools that will
make our lives easier as Pokémon trainers, either if you play solo or competitively.

The Living Dex tracker is just the start of all I want to do. By creating this site, I also learned a lot about modern
frontend development, which makes my journey as an engineer even greater.

## How to support

**If you want to support me and this website** or some of other my projects, articles, or existing assets, you can do so
via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZJX6VGBGTB8G4) or with a coffee in
[Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/itsjavi).

If you subscribe via our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/supereffective), you will unlock extra space and benefits in
the website. This is the preferred way, since it is automated.

The amount is not important, but I always appreciate that the community cares about what I do, and it helps me staying
motivated.

You can also support in other ways:

- As a developer: If you are a front-end developer with great experience in NextJS and React, please contact me!

- Following us on social media and sharing the website with others (links, retweets, in videos, etc).
- Reporting issues on our Project Board or our Discord server, providing valuable feedback (which is not only about
  asking when will a feature be available).
- Any other way that is mentioned in the footer of the website.
