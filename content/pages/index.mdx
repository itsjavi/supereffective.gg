SuperEffective.gg is a Pokémon fan site born in 2022, that brings you various mobile-friendly fully featured tools such
as: the [National Pokédex](/apps/pokedex), the [Living Pokédex Tracker](/apps/livingdex) with a Box Organization system,
the recently released [Super Pokédex Tracker](https://supeffective.com/) with support for all Pokédexes (national and
regional) of all games, and... more helpful tools to come!

Our Pokédex Tracker currently supports:

- All officially revealed species and forms that are transferrable to Pokémon HOME (or will be in the future) from
  Generations 1 to 9.
- Tracking for all current and upcoming main series games including Scarlet and Violet, together with Pokémon HOME and
  Pokémon GO.
- Tracking Gigantamax Pokémon and Alpha Pokémon.
- Tracking all released Shiny variants.
